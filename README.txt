>> Data structure

The first line shows the total number of embeddings and their dimension size, separated by a space. In each line below, there are two fields separated by a space: <the Chinese word or phrase> and <the corresponding embedding vector>. For each embedding vector, its values in different dimensions are also separated by spaces.
